# Rock-Paper-Scissors-in-Python (NON GUI Game)

In this project at OpenGenus, we explored the rock paper scissors game.

General rules for understanding the game:

1. If user1 picks Rock and user 2 picks Scissors, then user1 wins.
2. If user1 picks Paper and user2 picks Rock, then user1 wins.
3. If user1 picks Scissors and user2 picks Paper, then user1 wins.
4. In all the other cases user2 wins.
5. If both user1 and user2 pick a similar action then it will result in a draw.
